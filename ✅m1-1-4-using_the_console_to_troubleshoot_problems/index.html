  <h1>Using the Console to Troubleshoot Problems</h1>
  <!--
    DIRECTIONS: These practice problems are all about getting used to the console's ability to report errors, both in HTML and Javascript code.
      -->

  <!--
  PROBLEM 1: The following HTML code works fine.  Try erasing one of the arrows, "<" or ">", surrounding the first "p" below and see what changes in the browser. Describe what malfunctions as a result of the error.  Enter your description in the space below.
  -->
  <p style="border: 2px solid blue">
    What happens as a result of erasing one HTML arrow?
    <!--ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
     The box disappears and it just 1 blue line.
    -->
  </p>

  <!--
  PROBLEM 2: The following HTML code works fine.  Now try erasing the slash just before the second "p" below and see what changes in the browser.
  -->
  /<p style="border: 2px solid green">
    What happens as a result of erasing the slash before the closing "p"?
    <!--ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
     The slash creates a space between the paragraphs
    -->
  </p>

  <script>
    /*
    PROBLEM 3: The following Javascript code works fine.  Try erasing the period after "console" and note the error that follows.  Log the error in the space below after fixing it so the code runs as normal.
    */
    console.log("uncought reference error")

    /*
    PROBLEM 4: The following Javascript code works fine.  Try capitalizing the word Log in "console.log()".  Log the error type in the space below after fixing it so the code runs as normal.
    */
    console.log("reference error console not defined")

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The following Javascript code has an error.  Uncomment the code to see the error pop up in the console, then try to find the error and fix it.
    */
  console.log("Why am I not printing? Typo Error Fixed")
